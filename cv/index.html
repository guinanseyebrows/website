<div id="summary">
<p>Hi, I'm Seth! I'm an agile IT professional with a diverse skillset spanning Linux/Unix-like, Windows and OS X environments, cloud engineering, LAN/WAN networking, physical infrastructure installation and maintenance, database administration, documentation  and support. 
My priorities lie in developing elegant &amp; flexible solutions to economize time and resource usage; continuously expanding my areas of technical ability; and efficient, accurate, and friendly communication. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to learn quickly and devise actionable solutions with discretion and care.
I would consider myself a proponent of the Unix philosophy, and enjoy working solo as well as in teams of like-minded enthusiasts who choose to make their living from their passions. It's also important for me to work in environments that align with my values - social/environmental justice, honesty, integrity and the promotion of knowledge and access to information via open-source and proactive education.

<p><em>"here&#39;s a nickel, kid"</em></p>

<p>my name is seth and i like computers.</p>

<p>specifically computers that run some form of <a href="http://voidlinux.org">linux</a> or <a href="http://openbsd.org">bsd</a>.</p>

<p>i&#39;m also into playing music, iconoclasm/anachronism, political theory, small thinkpads, small keyboards, small structures, &#39;ricing&#39; (but not that term) and design (systems and <a href="design.html">graphic</a>).</p>

<p>i&#39;m really not into money, meat, monoculture, alliteration (alas), right-libertarianism, racism, misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, or anybody who refers to women as &#39;females&#39;.</p>

<p>i currently live outside of honolulu, hawaii, but i have spent a lot of time in the pacific northwest, the netherlands and the sf bay area.</p>

<p>i married the love of my life in 2018 and i live with her and our two dogs, moose and debbie.</p>

<p>i get paid to deploy, improve and manage linux servers in the cloud on behalf of my employer&#39;s customers, as well as develop new products. </p>

<p>i speak bash, postgresql, tcp/ip, &#39;unix&#39;, python, a little perl, and i have a good handle on a handful of other interpreted languages. for a more detailed look, check out my <a href="http://seth.nvsbl.org">resume</a>.</p>

<p>i&#39;m a big fan of implementing the unix philosophy in computing. my beard is invisible. in fact, i don't have a beard and i don't want one. too itchy.</p>

<p>when it comes to music, i'm mostly into neocrust, skramz, fastcore, 2000s pop punk, 90s east coast hardcore hiphop, techstep/darkstep and sad/slow stuff. some music i like includes textbook traitors, la quiete, pretend, pre-2000s modest mouse, ekkaia, tragedy, fall of efrafa, alpinist, svffer, charles mingus, dude ranch-era blink 182, daniel johnston, duster and all types of ill shit.</p>

<p>as far as reading goes, i like robert jordan, neal stephenson, william gibson, joe abercrombie, jane mayer, j.r.r. tolkien and brian jacques.</p>

<p> i love watching buffy/angel, letterkenny, trailer park boys, desperate housewives, friday night lights, comedy bang bang and bad procedurals like criminal minds and ncis.</p>

<p>i&#39;ve also been in a handful of bands throughout my life, including but surely not limited to <a href="https://torero.bandcamp.com">torero</a>, <a href="https://oaklandconnoisseur.bandcamp.com">connoisseur</a>, <a href="https://iamsorryftdoc.bandcamp.com">i am sorry (forthedeclineofcivilisation)</a>, <a href="https://lice808.bandcamp.com">LICE</a>, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/itallreturnstonothing">itallreturnstonothing</a> and <a href="https://soonhxc.bandcamp.com">s&oslash;&oslash;n</a>.</p>

<p>i play the drums. i also play guitar and bass, and i&#39;ve done vocals in a handful of bands as well. besides playing, i also record, mix and produce different kinds of music, mostly using logic pro.</p>
